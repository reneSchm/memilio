# Simple SECIR model 

This model is an very simplified application of the SECIR model implemented in https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/cpp/models/ode_secir/ not stratified by age groups.
The example is based on https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/pycode/examples/simulation/secir_simple.py which uses python bindings to run the underlying C++ code.
