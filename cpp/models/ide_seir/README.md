# IDE SEIR model

This model is based on Integro-differential equations. The four compartments 
- Susceptible, may become exposed at any time
- Exposed, becomes infected after some time
- Infected, will recover after some time
- Recovered

are used to simulate the spread of the disease.

An example can be found in [examples/ide_seir.cpp](../../examples/ide_seir.cpp)
